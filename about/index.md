Hey there! So, picture this: I'm like a tech wizard with a cape made of code, juggling languages like Java, Kotlin, Typescript, and more. I've danced with databases, wrestled with REST APIs, and even tamed the wild beasts of microservices.

I've had a whirlwind romance with Android development for over four years. From enhacing UPI payments at PhonePe, India to building apps for social causes and freelance gigs I've done it all. 

Education-wise, I've got a master's from the National University of Singapore, where I honed my coding chops and graduated with flying colors. 

In my free time, I've dabbled in teaching, mentoring, and even battling it out in hackathons like a true warrior of the keyboard. 

So, if you need a tech guru who can sling code like a pro and crack a joke while doing it, I'm your guy. Let's make some magic happen in the world of bits and bytes! ðŸš€

PS: This website was built back in the days when developing static sites using Jekyll was the craze, it may not reflect my latest adventures. So, if you're wondering why I'm not dropping buzzwords like confetti, it's because there hasn't been a refresh in a while.
